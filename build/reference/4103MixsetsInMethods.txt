@@description
<p> In Umple, code labels can be used to indicate variation points within methodsâ€™ statements. These labels can be utilized by aspects to inject code, which directly access method bodies in these specific locations. The (re)use of code labels within methods allows finer variability at the statement level. Therefore, code labels act as variability identification within statements inside methods. This counters the need for addition of hook methods in compositional approaches.
