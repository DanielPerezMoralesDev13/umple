<p> In Umple, code labels can be used to indicate variation points within methodsâ€™ statements. These labels can be utilized by aspects to inject code, which directly access method bodies in these specific locations. Code labels within methods allows finer variability at the statement level and help to counter the need for addition of hook methods in Umple. 
For example, the main method in the code below contains three lables: Hello_Label, Beautiful_Label, and Wonderful_Label. They are utilized by the aspects of three mixsets (Hello, Beautiful, and Wonderful) to inject some print statements.</p>
