Require Statement
Mixsets and Filters
noreferences

@@description
<p> Require statements help to specify dependencies and relationships among mixsets. For example, the mixset M1 (Line 2) requires the mixset M2 (Line 6), but both are not part of the feature model.</p>

<p>For feature modeling, two keywords isFeature and subfeature can be used to construct feature model segements. When a mixset acts as an optional feature; the keyword isFeature has to be included as an attribute in the mixset body.
subfeature keyword forms a parent-child relationship between the source mixset and the target mixset and both will become features. .</p>
