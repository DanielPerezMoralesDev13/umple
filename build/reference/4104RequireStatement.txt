<p>Require statements in Umple are used to specify dependencies and relationships among mixsets.</p>

<p>In the simplest case a require statement simply declares that certain code requires the presence of a certain mixset and that it would be an error if there is no use statement for this mixset. If the require statement is itself in a mixset, then it is stating that mixset requires the presence of one or more others. In the first code example below, the mixset M1 (Line 2) requires  mixset M2 (Line 6). Mote that the specification of the required mixset M2 is in square brackets: That is because the argument to the require statement is a Boolean condition involving mixsets with logical connectors</p>

<p>Require statements can also be used to specify that mixsets are features. For feature modeling, two keywords <i>isFeature</i> and <i>subfeature</i> are used to construct feature model segements. When a mixset acts as an optional feature; the keyword isFeature has to be included in the mixset body. The subfeature keyword on a require statement forms a parent-child relationship between the source mixset and the target mixset and both will become features.</p>

<p>The second code example below contains multiple features that form a feature model. Line 5 indicates that GSM1800 is required but that GSM1900 is not. Line 9 states that one or both of two sound features is required. Line 18 states that up to one of three resolution features is required (i.e. only at most one).  Line 21 contains a use statement that produces a software variant with five features.</p>
