Mixsets with State Machine

@@description
<p>State machine models can contain variable units through employing inline mixsets, or compositional mixsets. For example, the mixset “HalfOpenFeature” in the code below captures the state “HalfOpen” state and the event comming from "Opening" into the “HalfOpen” state. The second code example shows an equivalent state machine model, but with a compositional mixset. </p>
